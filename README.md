# JukeboxMk2

For easy collaborative spotify playlists. 

Spotify has a collaborative mode, but it requires copying a link and sharing it to individual friends. This is notionally a little bit easier, and doesn't require everyone to have spotify accounts.

Also I made a version of this based off Youtube before Spotify made theirs, so they can get off my lawn ðŸ‘´

I've replaced the youtube version with this version based on spotify (hence the mk2) because spotify doesn't have ads and junk. I originally put it together in 4 hours for a NYE party, so it's a touch rough, but I've since added the ability for anyone to create playlists.
